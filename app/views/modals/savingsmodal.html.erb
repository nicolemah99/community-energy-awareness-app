    <h1>Diesel Savings</h1> 
    <br>
    <p> Kotzebue Electric Association (KEA) has been on the cutting edge of using
											renewable energy since the early 1990s. By introducing the renewable energy
											sources solar and wind power, they have reduced the amount of diesel needed
											to generate energy. The introduction of wind power in Kotzebue displaces
											250,000 to 300,000 gallons of diesel fuel annually (about 20% of annual
											power needs). The excess renewable energy gets saved in the battery,
											displacing 25, 000 gallons of heating fuel yearly. <br>
											<br> By changing from non-renewable energy sources to renewables the cost of
											producing electricity goes down. This results in money savings that goes
											towards the community and development in other areas. It also decreases the
											home electricity bills for KEA members.
